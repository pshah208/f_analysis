# ppt-Generator

This is a slight edit of the code prepared by AIAnytime. For my usecase I wanted ChatGPT to use  information in a local folder to prepare powerpoint presentations instead of the data it is trained on.

For that I have edited the code that found on his github and instead of using Legacy openai.Completion function to create Slide Titles I am using Langchain repositories. It allows me to parse through the local documents and build ppt based on the information found there.
